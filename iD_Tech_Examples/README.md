## iD Tech Programming Labs 101 Examples
#### While I was an instructor at the iD Tech Programming Academy at Princeton, I developed these examples to show the students alongside the iD Tech curriculum.

##### Java
1. Calculator.java was an early java project we discussed. It covered several basic concepts, but was primarily used as the first project to introduce methods.
2. Hangman.java was the last intro-to-java project we did before moving on to C++. It recovered the basics and methods, but added in working with global variables and using arrays.

##### C++
1. Tic-Tac-Toe.cpp was the main C++ project we focused on (but certainly not the only one). It was a culmination of variables, loops, methods, arrays, and I/O in c++, as well as an introdution to 2D arrays.

##### Python
1. pong.py was a very independent, cool-down project we did to wrap up both Python and the first week. After the students were guided to create a bubble buster game, I had them attempt to replicate, independently, this pong game that I showed them.

##### JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
###### (All of these files were used in our mid-session, Sunday night hackathon. I chose to introduce the students to jQuery as it is a popular and useful JavaScript library.)
1. example_games.html laid out two game boards--one for tic-tac-toe, another for connect four.
2. example_games.css style the boards such that they were centered and distinct on the page.
3. example_games.js used jQuery to allow the users to interact with the game boards.
4. Note:  these were/are incomplete files and were used to show templates and examples of the three languages listed above. Unlike the other projects, which the students were encouraged to replicate, these files were meant to inspire the students to build their own projects.
